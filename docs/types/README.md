# types

Types entrypoint.

Central index for internal types. Prefer importing specific symbols from their
defining modules (e.g., `@internal-types/agentConfig`) for tree clarity; this
file exists primarily to provide a discoverable doc surface and future-proof
re-exports if needed.

## Remarks

This project follows a “types-as-docs” approach. Place comprehensive
descriptions and examples on exported types/interfaces in their source files
(not here). Keep this file light-weight to avoid duplication.
