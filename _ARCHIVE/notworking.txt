  --summary "Extend DatabaseAgent init tests and verify E2E workflow" \
  --context "Extended DatabaseAgent initialization coverage with success and failure-path tests and ran full compile/test gates to validate end-to-end behavior." \
  --changes "- Added init-focused tests in tests/databaseAgent.test.ts to assert that all configured categories are wired as data sources.
- Added negative-path coverage for missing required data sources (people category) to ensure clear failure behavior.
- Ran npm run compile and npm test on feat/dbagent-init-e2e to verify DatabaseAgent behavior in the broader workflow." \
  --architecture "- No structural changes to DatabaseAgent; tests exercise the existing configuration-driven data source wiring.
- Confirms DatabaseAgent continues to rely on UserContextAgent-provided categories and maintains cache behavior for queries." \
  --testing "Build: PASS (npm run compile); Tests: PASS (npm test, 51 suites; 337 tests; 2 skipped); Docs: N/A; Health: N/A" \
  --impact "- Increases confidence that DatabaseAgent initialization is robust across configured categories and misconfigurations.
- Reduces risk of regressions by locking expected behavior into unit tests while keeping the public MCP/extension surface unchanged." \
