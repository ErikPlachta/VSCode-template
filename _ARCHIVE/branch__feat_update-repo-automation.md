# Branch Focus: Improving CoPilot Instructions, Session Context, ChangeLog and TODO Management

The goal of this branch is to improve how we manage CoPilot Instructions, Session Context, CHANGELOG, and TODOs to help keep LLM Agents focused and prevent drift.

## Focus Areas

1. You'll be reviewing the new `SESSION-CONTEXT.md` file, and then comparing it to `copilot-instructions.md` to help me develop a better solution to keep LLM Agents aware and prevent drift.
2. Then, We'll be looking at `CHANGELOG.md`. This is managed pretty well by CoPilot chat, but I think it's instructions and how it's being managed/used will change with this new `SESSION-CONTEXT` design.
3. Then we'll be looking at `TODO.md`. This is a new MarkDown File with some derivations from the current design. We'll be updating logic in `bin` and `instructions.md` to pull TODOs out of CHANGELOG and move here instead.
4. Then you'll be looking for other orphaned files created by CoPilot when Drift started happening, and it started creating files to help it stay focused. We'll be cleaning these up and making sure everything has a clear purpose and place. `EXTENSION_TEST.MD`, `TESTING_GUIDE.md`, and `Orchestrator_worfklow_Analysis__20251110.md`.

## Background

- SESSION-CONTEXT.md is a new markdown file I've created, in hopes that we can have CoPilot Chat use it to stay focused and keep track of current session level details it would normally keep within it's memory.
  - I've created this because I notice LLM's are quickly losing focus and forgetting key-concepts and general instructions that already live in `copilot-instructions.md`.
  - I'm trying to figure out the best way to prevent this from happening.
  - I'm afraid to add too much detail to `copilot-instructions.md` because the code within the application is changing a lot.
  - My hope is that we can have CoPilot Chat keep this file updated as the session progresses.
- The `CHANGELOG.md` and all related logic has been really effective, but I'm noticing a decent amount of drift from the design intention.
  - Specifically related to TODO management, current tasks, current focus, and all related details.
  - I noticed CoPilot chat is looking for a landing spot for documenting it's current focus, research, and all related details for the current session. I'm hoping we can use `SESSION-CONTEXT.md` for this, by keeping a clear separation of concerns.
  - I noticed that CoPilot chat starts to get lost in the details as the level of TODOs and tasks grow in complexity. My hope is that we can use `TODO.md` and `SESSION-CONTEXT.md` to help with this, by keeping a clear separation of concerns.

## Suggested Steps

These are what I believe to be the best steps to take in order to complete this work.

> Please review them, do an integrity review of my plan, and make any adjustments you believe are necessary before proceeding.

1. Create a folder in the bin, `bin\RepoAutomation\`, that you can use during this request to file in the root as a working space.
   - I'd eventually like these to be permanent files that are used as templates/references for validating and maintaining both `copilot-instructions.md`, `SESSION-CONTEXT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `TODO.md`.
   - Create sub-folders for each of the 4 files to keep things organized and to be used in next steps.
   - Create a README.md file in the root of this folder to document what this folder is for.
2. Create a backup of each current version of the files in their respective folders.
   - Maybe a sub backup folder should exist so that it's clear these are backups and not modified by logic
   - Then copy the current versions of each file into their respective folders for the next steps
3. Research Best Practices for developing and maintaining a CoPilot Instructions File.
   - Look for examples, templates, and best practices.
   - Create a specific folder for copilot-instructions, and then a markdown file within it to document your findings.
   - Collect links, examples, common pitfalls, and anything else you find useful related to this topic. This may include downloading templates and examples from reputable resources.
   - This research will be used in the next steps.
4. Do an integrity review of CoPilot Instructions.
   - Use your research Look for violations, areas of improvement, etc.
   - Don't change anything yet, just document your findings in a markdown file within the folder.
   - Create a markdown file within the copilot-instructions folder to document your findings, integrity review, and areas of improvement.
5. Now review the new `SESSION-CONTEXT.md` file.
   - This file is a summary generated by Claude Sonnet 4.5 summarizing it's current context during a long development session, to help provide context to a new chat session. I've made some minor edits to it to help improve it's structure and clarity.
   - Look for violations, areas of improvement, etc.
   - Don't change anything yet, just document your findings in a markdown file within the folder like CoPilot Instructions.
   - Key Points:
     - IMO there is too much information in this file.
       - I'm guessing a decent amount of this information should live in copilot-instructions.md.
       - Some of it should live in TODO.md.
       - Some of it should live in CHANGELOG.md.
       - Some of it should be removed entirely.
     - The file needs a clearer structure and organization.
     - The sections and organization is not guaranteed accurate or complete.
   - The end of this file should contain
6. Now review the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
   - I want to strip out the TODOs and all Task Management details from this file.
   - Key Points:
     - CHANGELOG should be focused on documenting changes made to the codebase.
     - It should not be used for task management or TODOs.
     - It should be concise and focused on relevant changes.
     - Identify what key details should exist to serve as instructions for maintaining this file in the future.
   - Don't change anything yet, just document your findings in a markdown file within the folder.
7. Now review the `TODO.md` file.
   - Note that this is not yet onboarded into the logic and is not yet being used. I created it as a starting place for this branch.
     - The current logic in `C:\repo\vscode-extension-mcp-server\bin\utils\changelog` will need to be extracted and modified to point to this file instead. Don't do this yet, just identify the related details. How we solve this problem will be part of the plan you create in the next step.
     - We'll need to make a plan for this.
   - Look for violations, areas of improvement, to be effective in our goal of keeping LLM Agents focused and preventing drift.
   - Don't change anything yet, just document your findings in a markdown file within the folder.
8. Then review any other orphaned files that were created by CoPilot Chat during drift.
   - Just create a folder for Example_Orphaned_Files within the RepoAutomation folder.
   - These files themselves were created by CoPilot Chat automatically when it started to drift and lose focus or when it's overwhelmed and needs to get organized.
   - The content within these files are less important than the context, and the content within is likely not accurate or complete.
   - Review each file to understand it's purpose: `EXTENSION_TEST.MD`, `TESTING_GUIDE.md`, , and `Orchestrator_workflow_Analysis__20251110.md`.
   - Consider the following questions for each file:
     - What problem was CoPilot Chat trying to solve when it created this file?
     - Is this problem already being solved by one of the other 4 files?
     - How do we update our other files to provide the critical details CoPilot Chat was looking for when it created these files?
     - How can we update the JSDOCs and comments within the `src` code to mitigate the need for these sort of files in the future? And how do we guarantee they're updated as the code changes?
     - Do we need to refactor and keep any of this content? If yes, how do we automate it and make sure it stays up-to-date?
     - How could we use the new `SESSION-CONTEXT.md` file to help with this in the future?
   - Don't change anything yet.
   - Document your findings in a markdown file within the folder.
9. Now that you have a good understanding of the current state of all these files, create a plan for improving them
   - Consider all of the research you've done, integrity reviews, and findings from each file.
   - The plan should focus on keeping LLM Agents focused and preventing drift.
   - Start by outlining the role of each file, how they're managed now, and how they should be managed in the future.
   - The plan should include specific changes to be made to each file, and how they will work together to achieve the goal of keeping LLM Agents focused and preventing drift.
   - The plan should also include any changes needed to the logic in `bin/` to support these changes.
   - Can we update and convert `C:\repo\vscode-extension-mcp-server\bin\utils\changelog` to a more generic `RepoAutomation` that can be used to manage all 4 files?
     - I don't love the name of this, so if think of a few different names and suggest them. (It's managing a few different things, but not `docs` specifically, just the core logic files used by the user and CoPilot Chat to stay focused and on track in this repo).
10. Once the plan is approved, proceed to implement the changes.
