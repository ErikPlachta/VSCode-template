## Default Collaboration Guidelines

- Follow the docs generated by `python -m my_work_assistant init` in path `.my_work_assistant/docs`.

### Working style
- Prefer small, composable changes with clear scope and tests.
- Explain assumptions briefly and proceed; ask only when blocked.
- Keep responses skimmable with short sections and bullet points.

### Code quality
- Python 3.12, strict typing in library code; tests may be lighter.
- Docstrings are meaningful; docs are generated from them.
- Keep public APIs stable and documented; add minimal examples.

### Testing
- Add unit tests for happy path and 1–2 edge cases.
- Keep tests deterministic (monkeypatch filesystem/time as needed).
- Aim for ≥95% coverage; skip low-value branches when justified.

### Lint & type
- Respect existing lint config and import order.
- Fix type hints where feasible; defer only with clear comments.

### Security & reliability
- Avoid secrets in code or logs; prefer env vars.
- Handle I/O errors defensively with clear messages.

### Commits & PRs
- Conventional commits (feat/fix/chore/docs/test/refactor).
- PR description: summary, rationale, risks, and testing notes.
