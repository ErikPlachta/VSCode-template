## Notes for Copilot

Maintain this file as the single source of truth for non-trivial changes.

Guidelines:

1. Use the Unreleased section for current work: Planned / Added / Changed / Fixed / Docs / Verification / Next Focus.
2. Include file paths for meaningful changes.
3. Update Verification after edits (Build / Tests / Lint / Docs / Health).
4. Add migration/deprecation guidance under Changed with a brief note.

## [Unreleased]

### Planned

- Replace `any` types in analytics modules (`src/shared/analyticsIntegration.ts`, `src/shared/agentAnalytics.ts`) with structured interfaces.
- Create/update remaining docs assets (if any new references appear) and keep health report green.
- Perform final sweep to replace legacy agent imports and plan deprecation removal of `relevant-data-manager` alias.
- Run repository-wide EOL normalization commit.
- Draft legacy config removal plan & deprecation warnings (`mcp.config.json`, loader).
- Param name normalization scan & adjustments.
- Final lint/compile/test sweep and repository health report.

### Added (2025-11-08 – Return type & docs remediation)

- Explicit return types added across agent config getters (clarification, data, database, orchestrator, relevantDataManager/userContext).
- Normalized fallback objects to ensure required fields present (e.g. `getResponseStyle`).
- Added missing documentation pages: structured IA pages `docs/guides/build-pipeline.md`, `docs/reference/tools/repository-health-agent.md`, `docs/concepts/orchestration.md` (root duplicates removed).
- Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to mandate CHANGELOG updates for all non-trivial changes.

### Verification (latest session 2025-11-08)

- Build: PASS
- Tests: PASS
- Lint: PASS – no errors; previous MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON warning resolved by adding `"type": "module"` to `package.json`.
- Health report: PASS (ESLint pattern tolerance added to avoid AllFilesIgnoredError).
- Docs: PASS – IA restructuring complete (no root duplicates); previous TypeDoc symbol warnings resolved by exporting `Priority` and re-exporting `AddFormats`.

### Verification (orchestrator cleanup follow-up 2025-11-08)

- Build: PASS
- Tests: PASS
- Lint: PARTIAL – 67 errors, 31 warnings remain (analytics integration/dashboard, dataAgent hasOwnProperty, extension JSDoc, configRegistry/configValidation unused params & JSDoc). Orchestrator now clean.
- Docs: PASS (unchanged)
- Health report: PASS (unchanged)

### Next Focus

- Replace `any` types in analytics and re-run lint to reach zero errors. (Completed for `analyticsIntegration`; `agentAnalytics` remains planned-only, no changes needed today.)
- Document analytics interfaces (new page if substantial) and update health verification.

### Changed

- Migrated progress tracking from `docs/PROGRESS.md` to the root `CHANGELOG.md` to avoid conflicts with docs governance.
- Refactored `bin/utils/postprocessDocs.ts` to promote generated pages directly into structured Diátaxis folders (guides/, concepts/, reference/) and remove obsolete root duplicates & nested subtree.
- Enhanced telemetry docs (`src/mcp/telemetry.ts`) with clearer cross-references and `@inheritDoc`, removing unsupported tags after lint feedback.
- Exported `Priority` type and re-exported `AddFormats` to resolve TypeDoc reference warnings.
- Added transitional User Context Agent (`src/agent/userContextAgent`) aliasing legacy Relevant Data Manager for incremental rename.
- Extended JSON schema patterns to support both `businessData` and `userContext` directories.

### Fixed (2025-11-08 – Analytics integration and config JSDoc sweep)

- `src/shared/analyticsIntegration.ts`
  - Removed remaining `any` usages; replaced with `unknown` and precise assertions.
  - Imported and returned `AgentUsageStats` for `getStats`; removed duplicate/placeholder JSDoc blocks and alignment issues.
  - Replaced dynamic require with static import for `createStandardReport`; used report preview to avoid unused var.
- `src/types/configRegistry.ts`
  - Completed JSDoc for util functions with hyphenated params and explicit `@returns` details.
- `src/types/configValidation.ts`
  - Removed unused import; underscored unused params in placeholder validators; updated JSDoc param names accordingly.
- `src/shared/agentConfigurationService.ts`
  - Normalized JSDoc alignment; simplified overly complex `@returns` types to valid forms.
- `src/mcp/prompts/index.ts`
  - Rewrote JSDoc to avoid destructured param namepaths; added nested option property docs for clarity.

### Fixed (2025-11-08 – Module type declaration)

- `package.json`
  - Added `"type": "module"` to eliminate Node `MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON` warning during lint runs.
  - Confirmed subsequent lint invocation no longer emits the warning.

### Docs

- Introduced this changelog as the single source of truth for Copilot Chat–managed work. Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to reference this flow and resume prompts.
- Added build pipeline, orchestration overview, and repository health agent documentation.
- Added JSDoc & TypeDoc Style Guide at `docs/guides/jsdoc-style-guide.md`; updated `mcpCache` and `telemetry` as exemplars for cross-linking and clearer contracts.
- Rewrote root `README.md` to be user-focused (install, configure, commands). Moved developer content to `docs/guides/development-workflow.md`. Updated links to structured docs to avoid TypeDoc copy warnings.

## [2025-11-08] Initialization and documentation hardening

### Added

- Repository-wide `@packageDocumentation` headers for missing files.

### Fixed

- JSDoc tag-line issues in `src/agent/interfaces.ts` and `src/extension/mcpCache.ts`.
- Initial pass adding explicit return types for clarification agent config getters.
- Auto-fix run reduced numerous JSDoc alignment warnings.

### Notes

- Current lint focus areas include remaining missing return types, `any` usage, parameter doc completeness, unused variables, malformed JSDoc types/namepaths.
- See Unreleased for structured follow-ups and technical-debt items.
- Verification (2025-11-08): Build & tests PASS. ESLint FAIL (136 errors). Health report shows JSON schema + markdown metadata PASS but alias resolution failure for direct lint scripts. Added planned remediation items above.
- Started rename migration: added UserContext agent/profile alias and broadened schema patterns; legacy paths still active.

### Fixed (2025-11-08 – Orchestrator typing & JSDoc cleanup)

- Refactored `src/agent/orchestrator/index.ts` to remove `any` usage in payload formatting, strengthen `messages` typing, and normalize JSDoc blocks (hyphenated params, blank lines, nested `context.topic`).
- Added safer summary generation with fallback strings to eliminate optional chaining replace errors.

### Changed (2025-11-08 – Orchestrator diagnostics)

- Updated orchestrator configuration access patterns to cast messages to required shapes locally, improving type safety without widening global config types.

### Verification Update (post-orchestrator cleanup 2025-11-08)

- Build: PENDING (to be re-run after batch of lint fixes).
- Tests: PENDING.
- Lint: IMPROVED – Orchestrator file now passes with zero errors; remaining analytics/type config JSDoc items outstanding.
- Docs: UNCHANGED (PASS).
- Health report: UNCHANGED (PASS).
