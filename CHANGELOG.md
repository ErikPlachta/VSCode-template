# Changelog

## 2025-11-05

### Context
- Repository previously hosted the **My Work Assistant** Python project with extensive CLI, API, and documentation assets.
- Latest reset replaced that codebase with a scaffold for the **My Business MCP** VS Code extension written in TypeScript.

### Current Update
- Confirmed the repository now focuses on the MCP-driven VS Code extension.
- Added TypeScript sources for syncing tools, prompting for schema-driven arguments, and wiring Copilot Chat commands/mentions.
- Configured project metadata, build scripts, and linting for the extension workflow.
