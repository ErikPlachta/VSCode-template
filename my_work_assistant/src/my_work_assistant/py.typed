# This file marks the package as providing PEP 561 type information.
#
# Tooling (mypy, pyright, etc.) uses the presence of "py.typed" in
# installed distributions to know that runtime type hints in this package
# are intended for type checking by downstream consumers.
#
# It is intentionally empty; its presence (and inclusion in package data)
# is what matters. See: https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/
