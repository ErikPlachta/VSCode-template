# Resources Related to This Project

Created this document as a personal reference of related resources and content
I am using while learning about MCP Servers in this project. Not all of it is
directly related to the codebase at this time. The plan is to update it later
once I've solidified application architecture and design intention.

## Visual Studio Code Extensions

High level details and resources related to understanding and working with Visual Studio Code Extensions.

- What is a VS Code Extension?
  - "A VS Code Extension is a package that adds functionality to Visual Studio Code."
  - "Extensions can enhance the editor's capabilities, add new features, and integrate with external tools and services."
  - "They can be created using JavaScript or TypeScript and can leverage the VS Code API to interact with the editor."
  - "Extensions can be published to the VS Code Marketplace for others to discover and use."
- MCP Servers and their relation to VS Code Extensions
  - VS Code Chat services leverage LLMs, which can interact with an extension running a MCP server.
  - "MCP Servers can be integrated into VS Code Extensions to provide AI-powered features and tool integrations."
  - "Extensions can use MCP to connect to external data sources and services, enabling advanced capabilities like natural language processing and data retrieval."
  - "By leveraging MCP, VS Code Extensions can offer a more interactive and intelligent user experience."
  - "MCP Servers can facilitate communication between the extension and various tools, allowing for seamless integration and enhanced functionality."

## `MCP` (Model Context Protocol)

High level details and resources related to understanding and working with `MCP`.

- What is `MCP` (Model Context Protocol)?
  - "MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open-source standard for connecting AI applications to external systems."
  - "An open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools."
  - "Facilitates communication between AI models and various tools, services, and data sources."
  - "Designed to be extensible and adaptable to different use cases and environments."
  - "Supports various communication patterns, including [`STDIO`](#stdio), [`JSON-RPC`](#json-rpc), and [`HTTP Clients`](#http-clients)."
  - "Provides a standardized way to define and register tools, making them discoverable and usable across different platforms."

## `MCP` Communication Patterns

A collection of different communication patterns supported by MCP tools listed alphabetically, organized by pattern type, and including relevant resources for understanding and implementing each pattern.

### `STDIO`

- Overview of `STDIO`
  - `STDIO` (Standard Input/Output) is a universal communication pattern.
  - A lightweight and efficient way for disconnected software solutions to communicate across different platforms and environments.
  - Utilizes standard input and output streams for data exchange.
  - Enables tools to operate as standalone processes.
  - Facilitates easy integration into existing workflows.
  - Supports cross-platform compatibility.
  - Ideal for simple input/output operations.

### `JSON-RPC`

- Overview of `JSON-RPC`
  - `JSON-RPC` is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol encoded in JSON.
  - Enables communication between clients and servers over a network.
  - Supports method calls, notifications, and responses.
  - Facilitates structured data exchange using JSON format.
  - Allows for asynchronous communication.
  - Widely used in web services and APIs.
  - Provides a simple and flexible way to invoke methods remotely.

### `HTTP Clients`

- Overview of `HTTP Clients`
  - `HTTP Clients` enable tools to communicate over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
  - Facilitate interaction with web services and APIs.
  - Support various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
  - Allow for sending and receiving structured data formats like JSON and XML.
  - Enable integration with cloud-based services and RESTful APIs.
  - Provide flexibility in handling authentication, headers, and query parameters.
