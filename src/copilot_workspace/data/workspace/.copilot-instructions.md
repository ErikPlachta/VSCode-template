# GitHub Copilot Chat Workspace Instructions

## Purpose
This workspace ships with the `copilot_workspace` Python library so Copilot Chat can immediately
understand how your organisation stores data, relationships, and automation routines.
It focuses on reproducible knowledge graphs, validation utilities, and Python entrypoints
that are compatible with Copilot Chat and the Copilot Python API helpers.

---

## Behavior
1. Load JSON configurations from `.github/copilot-instructions-work/config/categories/**`.
2. Read `dataset.json` and `bridge.json` from each category to discover relationships.
3. Use `features` scripts to reset, validate, or regenerate content dynamically.
4. Emit diagnostics and logs into `.github/copilot-instructions-output`.
5. Use the `copilot_workspace.actions` Python API for advanced exploration.

- **categories/** → Domain specific datasets (job, company, people, data, apps, coding).
- **utilities/** → Templates, schemas, and example data models used by the Python helpers.
- **features/** → Feature scripts (setup, validation, reset, changelog) invocable from Python.
- **copilot-instructions-output/** → Log and output folder for validation results.

## Features
- Full schema validation and dataset sample generation
- Self-healing framework regeneration scripts
- Built-in changelog tracking Copilot Chat interactions and updates
- Segmented validation and reset utilities for controlled execution
- Optimised to integrate with the `copilot_workspace` Python API

## Example Queries
- “Show all bridges connecting company and people datasets.”
- “What workflows exist for my role in the job category?”
- “Validate all configurations and output logs.”
- “List the Copilot workspace actions exposed by the Python API.”
