# my_work_assistant

This repository contains the **my_work_assistant** Modular Copilot Plugin (MCP) server package. The project delivers an opinionated toolkit that manages `.github` collaboration assets, maintains a local `.my_work_assistant` workspace, and exposes both FastAPI and stdio transports for Copilot Chat clients.

The package ships with defaults, schemas, and documentation under `my_work_assistant/bin`, ensuring that runtime behavior is fully data-driven. All runtime artifacts are stored inside the `.my_work_assistant` directory and intentionally excluded from version control.

Refer to `my_work_assistant/README.md` for detailed usage guidance.
